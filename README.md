Project: Basic Informational Site
Odin Project NodeJS Course

Very basic informational site that contains 4 pages: index, about, contact-me and 404.

Content of these pages isn’t really all that important so there’s no need to spend a 
lot of time filling them up or trying to make them look pretty.

Assignment:
1. Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
  - index.html
  - about.html
  - contact-me.html
  - 404.html
    
2. Create your node.js server file index.js and add the code needed to serve the
right page according to the url.
  - localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
  - localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
  - localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
  - 404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.

How to run:
  - download project
  - navigate to project directory
  - type npm install
  - type node index.js

Nothing special here, it is just a very basic NodeJS server example to practice some
basic routing. In my opinion there are way better ways to achieve the same result(Express.js) 
so this task was a bit pointless.
